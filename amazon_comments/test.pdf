This case feels amazing on the hand and very premium. It‚Äôs easy to put on, and once one it feels very sturdy and has a good grip to it, so it won‚Äôt slip while holding. The back is not super see through, but you can still see the Apple a bit, the only thing with it is that it‚Äôs a fingerprint magnet. The camera protection is great as well. MagSafe works perfectly.

The presentation of the product is great: comes pretty protected, the case is inside a plastic bag and behind there‚Äôs the 2 screen protectors that were in immaculate condition. They also include stickers! Very cute touch. It comes with all the tools you need to install the screen protectors too. Considering the price this is a great case. 10/10
Case feels great, solid, and looks aesthetically nice. Cut outs for the camera and other holes line up perfectly. MagSafe works too. I genuinely do believe that this is a solid case but the only thing that bothers me about the case I received is that the right side feels a bit loose. It just makes my phone feel weird whenever I hold it and it feels loose. Maybe it‚Äôs the case I received but overall I do believe that this is a solid case at a good price point.

Update: the company took the time to send me a new case for free and it feels great!! This is such a great case! MAG safe, material, and protection quality is awesome! Would highly recommend!!!
This is a great deal. You get a phone case and screen protectors?!?! I loved this phone case because of the magsafe in the back. I also loved that it had the camera protector which was extremely important when deciding what phone case I was going to go with. It‚Äôs true to size and extremely durable (I drop my phone ALLLLLL the time). It‚Äôs comfortable to hold and not bulky at all. It does the job and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new phone case.
It looks really clean. I love that it protects the cameras and feels great in my hands with a MagSafe pop socket. Would recommend.
The phone case is nice and seems to hold up if it is dropped. The only problem I have is the case is very slippery and it can easily slide through your hand.
5 stars for this brilliant case! Fits perfect and feels great. The MagSafe works really well. It's slim and looks really good plus it keeps my phone safe from bumps and scratches. I'm really happy with it!
Case is actually perfect. Not bulky or annoying to hold. Perfect fit especially with protecting the cameras. Case leaves enough room to play with the new camera button. And all the other buttons ARE NOT stupid hard to press. overall quality of case is amazing. The stickers and thank you card makes me wanna buy from them again ngl hahah. Delivery time one business dayü§© for me at least. Thank you!
Great case, really protects the phone. Comes with 2 screen covers as well. Great packaging and instructions for install. Used on my new iPhone16.
I know it is too early for a review since the iPhone 16 has not been released yet but I have one for my iPhone 13 Pro Max and love it. There are a few things that set this one apart for me.
1. First it has individual cutouts for each camera and not just a big square. This helps eliminate dust from getting between the case and the phone. It also makes that area and the case sturdier.
2. It comes with two screen protectors like many cases but this brand also includes a plastic alignment tool to make certain that the screen protector goes on straight. This allignment tool is not mentioned in the product description but it was also included with the 13. Bravo.
3. The translucent back allows the iPhone color to come through and it keeps the case looking cleaner than the totally clear cases that end up yellowing or getting color transfer from your pocket.
A great case. Well packaged and nicely designed.
This is my second iPhone case by this manufacturer because I am a returning customer. The case itself is slim but protective and includes a cutout for the new Camera Control button. Comes with a nice screen protector which I used to think was silly but now I see it as added protection and no downside since it doesn‚Äôt affect touch responsiveness. The orange screen protector guide helped me install without misalignment. Lastly, the bundle comes with stickers that my daughter loves, so that‚Äôs definitely worth something!
The case is perfect but the screen protector is just acceptable. The screen protector is thick and has sharp edges so dust collects around the edges. I feel like the screen protector is not big enough to cover the entire phone screen because after applying the screen protector, one of the edges is not covered and you will see a rainbow line on the edge. I didn't expect much from the screen protectors that come with the case so for me this is a great case
I ordered the phone case in the color gold and it goes perfect with the iPhone 16 pro series in Desert Titanium! Though the color of the case is called ‚Äúgold‚Äù, it gives more of a beige finish, which gives the phone a very sleek look that I love! This also comes with not 1 but 2 screen protectors, which was very easy to put on! I‚Äôm excited to see how well this case holds!
I don‚Äôt write many reviews, but I felt compelled as this is a great case for a very reasonable price. I also love that the back is matte so you can see some of the color of the phone come through but none of the dust you typically get with clear cases. We‚Äôll see how it holds up over time, but no complaints currently.
I love this case! Thin, fits very well, protects nicely. One tiny issue is the new camera button on the 16, where you can rub your finger up/down on the button to zoom in/out, is a little impeded. You can still do it but it‚Äôs a bit harder. Overall still highly recommended.
The product came with a decent case and 2 temper glass screen protecter and some very cute stickers
I thought I was just getting a phone case but having also gotten a screen protector for barely 30 is a really good deal normally at phone stores you would pay 60-80 for same product love this product definitely recommend
iPhone 16 pro. Typically I always order a new case so it‚Äôs here when I get the phone. It arrived a week before the phone. Included screen protector was cool. Most times they kinda fit the phone but this was like a glove. Great case for the price, over the top packaging. Thank you!
I have bought many many cell phone cases over the last 30 plus years. I am totally impressed by this one. It even includes a screen protector, two of them. Everything in the package showed so much attention to detail it was astonishing. BRAVO
I ordered this to replace my old OtterBox which fell apart and the quality of this product is so much better. From the texture of the case and it's aesthetics to the function of the camera protection and magsafe compatibility I'm very very pleased. I would recommend this case to anyone.
The case is good, I love the built in camera protector plus it comes with screen protectors included. My only gripe is that the case can be slippery to the touch. I wish the case was more rugged and not prone to dropping because of the slippery ness of the feel.
Needed a phone case to get me through. Ordered this one because of the price and it is definitely worth it. 2 glass screen protectors included make it worth it alone. Also pretty cool that they include some cute stickers in the box and a thank you note.
Phone case is exactly as described! My pop socket with MagSafe adheres so well I didnt think it would come off but it does. Getting two screen protectors with this case purchase is a fantastic deal for the price! Fits my new iPhone 16 pro perfectly.
It was amazing and had the perfect amount of thickness, grip, and ease of removal.

The only problem is that after about 6 months the MagSafe on the back started to scratch as you can see in the image. This is the only reason I took off a star

Other than that really good case for this phone!
looks nice, but I wanted a stronger magnet. It was as strong as the one I got for mu 12 pro max, but I found another case with a stronger hold. This one was a good deal, but I wanted the stronger hold.
Now that I‚Äôve sent this case and felt it I would have paid double. I purchased a $60 case from Apple that doesn‚Äôt come close to this. Do yourself a favor and buy it
I have MS so I drop things especially my phone. I have replaced multiple cracked protection glasses but I couldn‚Äôt put a cover on because of the magnetic charge. This works great with the magnet. I no longer need to take cover off to charge. No longer replacing glass all the time.
I drop my phone to much. The durability of this case is AMAZING! I love how easy it is to get on and off. The magnet strength is amazing! I have a magnetic ring I put on it when I‚Äôm not charging it that has a little ring on the inside to hold my phone when taking photos or playing games on it. It‚Äôs so easy to hold & I love the color of it! Can‚Äôt beat the price
Packaging was excellent and it comes with 2 screen protectors just what I needed for my iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Grip on the case is better than most out there and buttons are easily accessible. Color matched perfectly with new phone. üí∏üï∫üèæ
Case is good/decent. The screen protectors on the outside of the screen don‚Äôt fully cover the phone unfortunately along the trim of the phone and has a weird looking color when the phone has a white screen. Hard to explain but might send it back. Some might notice some might not.
Fits perfectly around my 16+ the color matches everything. I just wish the clear part wasn‚Äôt too blurred. I really want to see the true beauty of the phone but other than that it‚Äôs great.
Good compromise between protection, slim fit and price. Nice having screen protectors included. Very good fit and button interface to phone. Built in lens protection. Recommended.
I recently purchased the TOCOL iPhone 16 case and am thoroughly impressed. The packaging was exceptional, making it a great first impression. The case itself is sturdy and well-designed, and I was pleasantly surprised to find two screen protectors and some stickers included for customization. These extras add significant value to the purchase. Overall, this is a fantastic case that offers both protection and style. Highly recommended!
Not sure why half the photos are upside down, but my 16 Plus came in today and it fits perfect, even came w 2 screen protectors but we already ordered the zagg privacy protectors
This case looks really nice and fits well, however the plastic material is much more slippery than other cases I have used in the past. I‚Äôm dropping my phone all the time!
this is a well built case and has survived a holder drop and cord breakage . no scratches on case and phone has no damage.
This is a phone cover that is excellent quality and sturdy, plus very pretty!! I‚Äôm very pleased with my purchase.
I love everything about this phone case. Fits perfect looks just like the picture feels good in hand.
I love the feel on the hand. And it comes with two screen protectors for free!!!!
This came with a sturdy phone case and glass protection / cleaning tools. I am happy with the product I received and would order again
Nice case, but it is too slick. Case constantly feels like it is falling out of my hand, it needs a more tactile surface.
It‚Äôs been a really great phone case. I work in construction and it handles the rougher circumstances I use my phone in. And their customer service is top notch. Everything about this case is great!!!
Fantastic can‚Äôt wait for my 16 Promax to show up, this one has protection around the lenses that other ones did not for the same price point!
Good durable case and screen protectors. However the case is very slippery which is annoying.
This case for the iPhone 16 Pro is great. The packaging was surprisingly good for a $16 case, which made the whole purchase even better. Definitely recommend.
The case is very well made for the price. I would highly recommend this case.
Only gave it a 4 star as the magnet could be stronger.
Great case fits great but the screen protectors develop air bubbles.
Color matches the blue very well. Case is sturdy, but not heavy.
Looks great, sturdy and came with two screen protecting glass covers
Love this case it fits perfectly and was sent fast
Got this for my 16 yo son and works on his drops of the phone.
Love this entire kit, comes with everything you need to protect your phone, including the screen protector
They even sent a few stickers and a thank you note in the package and it was great quality!
So as the title says, it‚Äôs a straight-forward simple iphone16 case with 2 glass screen protectors. Very minimal won‚Äôt add any crazy bulk to your phone, it has a frosted back so you can still appreciate your favorite iphone color and style. It includes support/warranty info, the case itself/ instructions, 2 clear screen protectors, and some stickers.
Only con or preference would be adding a SEALED charging port if not the rest of the open ports, and an alignment tool for the screen protectors because boy do I not like self aligning those on any case. However there is a good chance that applying the case first probably assists in this regard. I would love to see more colors/clear back and slightly stronger magnet though it does the job as is.
Sleek and durable. Covers around the camera lens to reduce dust. Ease of installation. Comes with 2 screens protector with applications. Item was well packaged. Delivered on time. Light weight and I got purple.
The price is pretty affordable with one case and two screen protectors! Highly recommended
Very nicely packaged. Looks premium quality
This case is comfortable extremely durable and is very easy to wirelessly charge, an addition to that it‚Äôs also a great value for money, because I had also purchased the rebel case which was 40 to 45Ish and it‚Äôs durability has not stood up to this ones!!!
excellent quality.
You get more than what you pay for, it‚Äôs a great product and it comes with stickers and 2 screen protectors, it‚Äôs absolutely amazing!
Awesome case.
Fit perfectly
Cover fits well and the magnet holds great! Highly recommend.
Overall, I‚Äôm happy with it. It looks very nice and well built.
Very simple case, Durable, Came with screen protectors and cleaning supplies for your screen. Only $10, you cannot beat that.
The baby blue color is very pleasing (to my eyes) and the covering on the camera helps out a lot if I get anxious about having dirt on my hands when touching my phone. My previous case was very thick, and I typically overheated my phone when I put it on my car phone mount, but this case does just fine. I dropped it once already and there is no damage to my phone. 9/10
Great protection for your phone!!
I love a slickness sturdiness and overall toughness of this case. My iPhone has taken so many licks and because of this case it‚Äôs always been protected. I will definitely buy it again.!
comes with case, multiple screen protectors, stickers, guide stickers. Best value for the price would recommend!
Very glad I bought this! And for under $15, it's a steal.

It looks nice, feels nice, and the MagSafe works just as good as any official Apple MagSafe case would.

The back does feel a tad slippery, but the sides provide all the grip you'll need. I've been using the case for over a month and have yet to drop my phone, despite being quite a clumsy person.

Very easy to put it in my pocket and just as easy to pull out, and there's never any lint. It will get stains from the oil on your skin, but it always looks as good as new after I clean it with a couple of alcohol prep pads.

Love that the case not only protects my camera, but keeps the camera area from getting dirty. At least, that's been my experience.

If you're on the fence, buy it! You really can't go wrong for that price.
Excellent item. Protects phone really well. Dropped few times from 3 ft, not even a scratch on the case. Comes with 2 tampered glass screen protectors, which was a plus and I was not aware of. Best thing is this is the strongest MagSafe case I‚Äôve had and I‚Äôve had more expensive cases that had really weak magnets!!!
Perfect fit
Was looking for a simple case for my phone and for the price, this one fit like a glove. Feels great, magnet is strong. No complaints. Would definitely buy again.
Packaging of the case is very elegant and carefully thought out. The case appears to be very protective, while also allowing ease of access to the new iPhone 16 Pro buttons, such as the new Camera Control. The back of the case is a frost-like color, but your phone‚Äôs color should still be able to be seen. Great value, as it comes with two screen protectors as well. Can‚Äôt wait to try it on my iPhone 16 Pro!
Fits right and is good for the price . Only issue is the back is very slick so sometimes I feel like the phone is gonna slide out of my hand . Great product tho
I got the iPhone 16 Pro case and the hard cover case was a little too short for my phone. It also doesn't have a hole cut out for the fingerprint button on the right side of my phone. Lastly, the camera holes don't align with my phone. Be careful when buying and make sure you're getting the right size.

Edit: I worked with customer service and found out the product I had received was in fact a defect. After I sent them pictures of my defected item, they kindly sent me the right product for my phone and it fit right. Quality seems somewhat okay but given my screen protector had cracked after a day of use, I'm going to leave my review at a 3. I think now that I have a hard cover case, some of the shock will be absorbed by that and my screen protector might last longer. Time will tell.
I don‚Äôt write reviews a lot, but honestly this is the best phone case I‚Äôve had in a while. Here‚Äôs why:
1. Covers my phone great
2. Has a good surface texture
3. magsafe
4. Bang for buck
5. The company seems to care

More details:
1. Covers my phone great
- I love how there is a slightly raised lip around the screen, but it‚Äôs not too intense that it‚Äôs annoying.
- I also love how the case covers as much of the cameras as possible without obstructing them. I always worry about my cameras getting bonked.
- honestly the case is just designed very well. There are lots of little details that I won‚Äôt list (like edges and stuff), but they make a big difference. So nice!

2. Good surface texture:
Personally, I don‚Äôt drop my phone a lot, and I mostly worry about scratches. Overly smooth cases make my phone slide off of these things, and grippy cases get stuck in my pocket. This case is a good middle ground. It‚Äôs comfortably smooth, but not too smooth.

3. MagSafe
The MagSafe works perfectly

4. Bang for buck
You get a great case, 2 glass screen protectors with the application stuff, and even some stickers all for like $14

5. Company seems to care
The product feels very high quality and comes with everything you need and more, including a nice note with stickers. I can tell that the people who made this product care about their product which I really appreciate.
very good/ got it on the next day
Case has been great strong hold for my MagSafe wallet and has held up with drops
This case is amazing! This is no sales gimmick and I‚Äôm not getting anything for this review! This case no joke stopped a chainsaw from cutting into my leg and phone! And it wasn‚Äôt a little crappy chainsaw its was a pretty big stihl saw. 10 out of 10 must buy! I‚Äôve also dropped my phone tons of times and she looks perfect.
Very good quality ! Protects the iPhone and is very cute. Get many compliments with my case.
This case is just "meh". Coming from having a full silicone case...the translucent side of this case makes it kind of slippery to hold. I almost dropped it a couple of times because I wasn't use to how slippery it would be. The biggest turn-off for me was there wasn't an alignment frame to align the screen protector. It came with alignment "stickers" which makes it even more difficult. I messed up 1 screen protector and had to throw it away and was super careful to not mess up the 2nd one. I would return this case if I hadn't used 1 of the screen protector yet. I will be finding another case to purchase.
Excellent
Tiene un agarre firme, es dura pero un poco suave para soportar ca√≠das, lo tengo por ya un tiempo y hasta ahora no he visto un ray√≥n lo que s√≠ pasaba con otros protectores, adem√°s el protector de pantalla es limpio y como cualquier otro, me ha salvado de que se me rompa la pantalla, la verdad el producto es muy recomendable
O saw reviews and got it instantly.
I like sleek and simple look.
It is very good to touch.
Lightweight. Perfect. And comes with too screen protectors.
Which are great quality as well.
I really recommend this if you are looking for a good phone case of the greatest quality.
Only real issue is I prefer not to have the cameras surrounded by case, but I love this case. The MagSafe magnet is super strong, easy to install and take off, love the color, feels durable, and has a nice subtle texture on the sides to help with grip.
I have had my otter box for the last few years and it finally started to break down about a week ago. I was going to order the same case I had but then I came across this one! It's much sleeker and I love that it covers and protects the back cameras, whereas my other did not! Plus I don't know any other company who would send cute stickers with the purchase!
I had an otter box case and they always peel after a month or so but this case is sleek and fits perfectly
Sheik and great feel.
Good built quality and all the buttons and openings lined up. Feels good in the hand and not too slippery. The only cheap looking part is the camera lens cover area. May be it is the color or the design but it is functional. The magsafe ring magnets can be a tad stronger. Good value for what I paid, so no complaints.
Good case with 2 screen glasses protector
Quality of the product was very shocking. Definitely would buy again. Only downside to the case was that the mag safe wasn‚Äôt very strong for connecting to other accessories. However, I had a small flat magnet that fit into the backside so I had no issues.
The case is nice based on durability except, the opening for camera button is like an obstruction. You have to press hard to click the button because of the case thickness around. The strength needed to push the button ultimately ends up blurring all the images because you have to press it very hard. I tried an apple sold case and that was not the case with theirs so that part is a design flaw. If you don‚Äôt plan to use the button, this case is good enough.
Love this case EXCEPT, as Tocol says, it has a "silky, non stick feel". That's the problem, it feels kinda slippery in my hand and dropping my new $1K phone is NOT what I want to do. I'm going to keep it and see if I can ruff up the sides with sand paper, maybe that will help. In the mean time, using Otter Symmetry, similar size and a nice safe/solid feel in my hands (camera protection not as good though). So close to a great product Tocol, so so close, but just off the mark.
Good quality. Made of rubber and side buttons work well
Awesome case!! Great protection as well!
I need a phone case that completely covers my camera (I seem to drop my phone more than normal). It does have raised lip to protect camera but I thought it had enclosed coverage.
Perfect case.
Phone case is sleek and slim fitting. Seller includes some cute stickers my kids love them.
Case also came with a screen protector, an amazing price considering all that you get!
Shortly after receiving I dropped my phone and it kept my phone safe.
Case is a very good one. Lightweight. Feels good in the hands. Very protective without being ‚Äúbulky‚Äù would highly recommend.
Fit my phone nice material easy to install
