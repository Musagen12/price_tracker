O saw reviews and got it instantly.
I like sleek and simple look.
It is very good to touch.
Lightweight. Perfect. And comes with too screen protectors.
Which are great quality as well.
I really recommend this if you are looking for a good phone case of the greatest quality.
Case feels great, solid, and looks aesthetically nice. Cut outs for the camera and other holes line up perfectly. MagSafe works too. I genuinely do believe that this is a solid case but the only thing that bothers me about the case I received is that the right side feels a bit loose. It just makes my phone feel weird whenever I hold it and it feels loose. Maybe it‚Äôs the case I received but overall I do believe that this is a solid case at a good price point.

Update: the company took the time to send me a new case for free and it feels great!! This is such a great case! MAG safe, material, and protection quality is awesome! Would highly recommend!!!
This is a great deal. You get a phone case and screen protectors?!?! I loved this phone case because of the magsafe in the back. I also loved that it had the camera protector which was extremely important when deciding what phone case I was going to go with. It‚Äôs true to size and extremely durable (I drop my phone ALLLLLL the time). It‚Äôs comfortable to hold and not bulky at all. It does the job and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new phone case.
5 stars for this brilliant case! Fits perfect and feels great. The MagSafe works really well. It's slim and looks really good plus it keeps my phone safe from bumps and scratches. I'm really happy with it!
Very simple case, Durable, Came with screen protectors and cleaning supplies for your screen. Only $10, you cannot beat that.
Excellent item. Protects phone really well. Dropped few times from 3 ft, not even a scratch on the case. Comes with 2 tampered glass screen protectors, which was a plus and I was not aware of. Best thing is this is the strongest MagSafe case I‚Äôve had and I‚Äôve had more expensive cases that had really weak magnets!!!
I know it is too early for a review since the iPhone 16 has not been released yet but I have one for my iPhone 13 Pro Max and love it. There are a few things that set this one apart for me.
1. First it has individual cutouts for each camera and not just a big square. This helps eliminate dust from getting between the case and the phone. It also makes that area and the case sturdier.
2. It comes with two screen protectors like many cases but this brand also includes a plastic alignment tool to make certain that the screen protector goes on straight. This allignment tool is not mentioned in the product description but it was also included with the 13. Bravo.
3. The translucent back allows the iPhone color to come through and it keeps the case looking cleaner than the totally clear cases that end up yellowing or getting color transfer from your pocket.
A great case. Well packaged and nicely designed.
Phone case is sleek and slim fitting. Seller includes some cute stickers my kids love them.
Case also came with a screen protector, an amazing price considering all that you get!
Shortly after receiving I dropped my phone and it kept my phone safe.
This is my second iPhone case by this manufacturer because I am a returning customer. The case itself is slim but protective and includes a cutout for the new Camera Control button. Comes with a nice screen protector which I used to think was silly but now I see it as added protection and no downside since it doesn‚Äôt affect touch responsiveness. The orange screen protector guide helped me install without misalignment. Lastly, the bundle comes with stickers that my daughter loves, so that‚Äôs definitely worth something!
I have MS so I drop things especially my phone. I have replaced multiple cracked protection glasses but I couldn‚Äôt put a cover on because of the magnetic charge. This works great with the magnet. I no longer need to take cover off to charge. No longer replacing glass all the time.
I drop my phone to much. The durability of this case is AMAZING! I love how easy it is to get on and off. The magnet strength is amazing! I have a magnetic ring I put on it when I‚Äôm not charging it that has a little ring on the inside to hold my phone when taking photos or playing games on it. It‚Äôs so easy to hold & I love the color of it! Can‚Äôt beat the price
Packaging was excellent and it comes with 2 screen protectors just what I needed for my iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Grip on the case is better than most out there and buttons are easily accessible. Color matched perfectly with new phone. üí∏üï∫üèæ
I recently purchased the TOCOL iPhone 16 case and am thoroughly impressed. The packaging was exceptional, making it a great first impression. The case itself is sturdy and well-designed, and I was pleasantly surprised to find two screen protectors and some stickers included for customization. These extras add significant value to the purchase. Overall, this is a fantastic case that offers both protection and style. Highly recommended!
Case is good/decent. The screen protectors on the outside of the screen don‚Äôt fully cover the phone unfortunately along the trim of the phone and has a weird looking color when the phone has a white screen. Hard to explain but might send it back. Some might notice some might not.
Fantastic can‚Äôt wait for my 16 Promax to show up, this one has protection around the lenses that other ones did not for the same price point!
It‚Äôs been a really great phone case. I work in construction and it handles the rougher circumstances I use my phone in. And their customer service is top notch. Everything about this case is great!!!
This case for the iPhone 16 Pro is great. The packaging was surprisingly good for a $16 case, which made the whole purchase even better. Definitely recommend.
Only gave it a 4 star as the magnet could be stronger.
Sleek and durable. Covers around the camera lens to reduce dust. Ease of installation. Comes with 2 screens protector with applications. Item was well packaged. Delivered on time. Light weight and I got purple.
You get more than what you pay for, it‚Äôs a great product and it comes with stickers and 2 screen protectors, it‚Äôs absolutely amazing!

So as the title says, it‚Äôs a straight-forward simple iphone16 case with 2 glass screen protectors. Very minimal won‚Äôt add any crazy bulk to your phone, it has a frosted back so you can still appreciate your favorite iphone color and style. It includes support/warranty info, the case itself/ instructions, 2 clear screen protectors, and some stickers.
Only con or preference would be adding a SEALED charging port if not the rest of the open ports, and an alignment tool for the screen protectors because boy do I not like self aligning those on any case. However there is a good chance that applying the case first probably assists in this regard. I would love to see more colors/clear back and slightly stronger magnet though it does the job as is.
Cover fits well and the magnet holds great! Highly recommend.
Overall, I‚Äôm happy with it. It looks very nice and well built.
The baby blue color is very pleasing (to my eyes) and the covering on the camera helps out a lot if I get anxious about having dirt on my hands when touching my phone. My previous case was very thick, and I typically overheated my phone when I put it on my car phone mount, but this case does just fine. I dropped it once already and there is no damage to my phone. 9/10
This case is comfortable extremely durable and is very easy to wirelessly charge, an addition to that it‚Äôs also a great value for money, because I had also purchased the rebel case which was 40 to 45Ish and it‚Äôs durability has not stood up to this ones!!!
I love a slickness sturdiness and overall toughness of this case. My iPhone has taken so many licks and because of this case it‚Äôs always been protected. I will definitely buy it again.!
comes with case, multiple screen protectors, stickers, guide stickers. Best value for the price would recommend!
Great protection for your phone!!
Very glad I bought this! And for under $15, it's a steal.

It looks nice, feels nice, and the MagSafe works just as good as any official Apple MagSafe case would.

The back does feel a tad slippery, but the sides provide all the grip you'll need. I've been using the case for over a month and have yet to drop my phone, despite being quite a clumsy person.

Very easy to put it in my pocket and just as easy to pull out, and there's never any lint. It will get stains from the oil on your skin, but it always looks as good as new after I clean it with a couple of alcohol prep pads.

Love that the case not only protects my camera, but keeps the camera area from getting dirty. At least, that's been my experience.

If you're on the fence, buy it! You really can't go wrong for that price.
Perfect fit
Was looking for a simple case for my phone and for the price, this one fit like a glove. Feels great, magnet is strong. No complaints. Would definitely buy again.
I don‚Äôt write reviews a lot, but honestly this is the best phone case I‚Äôve had in a while. Here‚Äôs why:
1. Covers my phone great
2. Has a good surface texture
3. magsafe
4. Bang for buck
5. The company seems to care

More details:
1. Covers my phone great
- I love how there is a slightly raised lip around the screen, but it‚Äôs not too intense that it‚Äôs annoying.
- I also love how the case covers as much of the cameras as possible without obstructing them. I always worry about my cameras getting bonked.
- honestly the case is just designed very well. There are lots of little details that I won‚Äôt list (like edges and stuff), but they make a big difference. So nice!

2. Good surface texture:
Personally, I don‚Äôt drop my phone a lot, and I mostly worry about scratches. Overly smooth cases make my phone slide off of these things, and grippy cases get stuck in my pocket. This case is a good middle ground. It‚Äôs comfortably smooth, but not too smooth.

3. MagSafe
The MagSafe works perfectly

4. Bang for buck
You get a great case, 2 glass screen protectors with the application stuff, and even some stickers all for like $14

5. Company seems to care
The product feels very high quality and comes with everything you need and more, including a nice note with stickers. I can tell that the people who made this product care about their product which I really appreciate.
very good/ got it on the next day
Case has been great strong hold for my MagSafe wallet and has held up with drops
This case is amazing! This is no sales gimmick and I‚Äôm not getting anything for this review! This case no joke stopped a chainsaw from cutting into my leg and phone! And it wasn‚Äôt a little crappy chainsaw its was a pretty big stihl saw. 10 out of 10 must buy! I‚Äôve also dropped my phone tons of times and she looks perfect.
Very good quality ! Protects the iPhone and is very cute. Get many compliments with my case.
Excellent
Tiene un agarre firme, es dura pero un poco suave para soportar ca√≠das, lo tengo por ya un tiempo y hasta ahora no he visto un ray√≥n lo que s√≠ pasaba con otros protectores, adem√°s el protector de pantalla es limpio y como cualquier otro, me ha salvado de que se me rompa la pantalla, la verdad el producto es muy recomendable
Packaging of the case is very elegant and carefully thought out. The case appears to be very protective, while also allowing ease of access to the new iPhone 16 Pro buttons, such as the new Camera Control. The back of the case is a frost-like color, but your phone‚Äôs color should still be able to be seen. Great value, as it comes with two screen protectors as well. Can‚Äôt wait to try it on my iPhone 16 Pro!
Only real issue is I prefer not to have the cameras surrounded by case, but I love this case. The MagSafe magnet is super strong, easy to install and take off, love the color, feels durable, and has a nice subtle texture on the sides to help with grip.
I have had my otter box for the last few years and it finally started to break down about a week ago. I was going to order the same case I had but then I came across this one! It's much sleeker and I love that it covers and protects the back cameras, whereas my other did not! Plus I don't know any other company who would send cute stickers with the purchase!
I had an otter box case and they always peel after a month or so but this case is sleek and fits perfectly
Fits right and is good for the price . Only issue is the back is very slick so sometimes I feel like the phone is gonna slide out of my hand . Great product tho
Sheik and great feel.
Good built quality and all the buttons and openings lined up. Feels good in the hand and not too slippery. The only cheap looking part is the camera lens cover area. May be it is the color or the design but it is functional. The magsafe ring magnets can be a tad stronger. Good value for what I paid, so no complaints.
Good case with 2 screen glasses protector
Quality of the product was very shocking. Definitely would buy again. Only downside to the case was that the mag safe wasn‚Äôt very strong for connecting to other accessories. However, I had a small flat magnet that fit into the backside so I had no issues.
Awesome case!! Great protection as well!
This case is just "meh". Coming from having a full silicone case...the translucent side of this case makes it kind of slippery to hold. I almost dropped it a couple of times because I wasn't use to how slippery it would be. The biggest turn-off for me was there wasn't an alignment frame to align the screen protector. It came with alignment "stickers" which makes it even more difficult. I messed up 1 screen protector and had to throw it away and was super careful to not mess up the 2nd one. I would return this case if I hadn't used 1 of the screen protector yet. I will be finding another case to purchase.
Product came fast and was just as described
